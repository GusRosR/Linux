# Description

On this file we will look at commands that are gonna be useful to monitor and see useful information
about what is happening on our system.

- w: This is the command for who and it shows who is logged on the system. The command who shows 
     a little less information but it's the same.
-top: Shows the running processes and which ones are consuming the most resources in descending order.
- netstat: This command shows network information like listening ports, stablished connections, tcp
           and udp interactions and so on. To get the most out of this command we must check the 
           documentation man page to see the different flags or arguments. We need to run this 
           command as superuser to get as much information as possible.
