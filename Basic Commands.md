# Description

Here we're gonna have a list of the most common commands on the command line, we're gonna exclude the
most basic commands as at this point they have to be almost memorized.



- man action|command|tool : Provides built-in documentation over a tool, action, app or command. In 
                            some cases we might need to search for more documentation on the internet
                            or with other commands.


- ls -a : Shows all (even hidden) directories and files of our system.
- cd /: Takes you to root folder.
- cd ~: Takes you to home folder.
- touch name.extension: Creates an empty file with the extension we specify as shown on the command.
- cat filename.extension: Shows the content of a file (If installed you can use                           bat instead for a pretier look).
- cd: The cd command with no arguments takes us directly to our home directory.
- mv origin/path/to/file destination/path/to/file: Moves a file from one place to another. It's
                                                   important to note that while moving it you can
                                                   also change the name of the file or we can change
                                                   directly the name of the file like this:
                                                   mv nameOfTheFile newNameOfTheFile.
- rm: Delete a file, some files may require you to use root access to delete them.
- rmdir: Deletes an empty folder.
- rm -r: Deletes a folder and everything underneath him.
- mkdir -p: Allows us to create nested folders like this: *mkdir -p some/nested/folder*.
- cp origin/path/to/file destination/path/to/file: This command is used to copy the contents
                                                    of a file into another one. It works as mv
                                                    with the difference it doesn't remove
                                                    the file from it's original location.
